Welcome to the 2020 Embedded 2 Virtual Lab!

TO DEPLOY THE SAMPLE PROJECT: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Using Vivado, open the "numato_reader_example". An error may be thrown regarding the 
DDR, for this sample project it is safe to ignore this.

2. Click File->Launch SDK . Include the Bitstream located at 
project_root/numato_reader_example.runs/impl1/design_1_wrapper.bit

3. Click on "Program FPGA" Button in the top button pannel (The red arrow and green blocks image)

4. Right-Click on the numato_read project in the Project Explorer. Click Run As -> Launch on Hardware (GDB)

5. The bitfile and software application are now running on the board. 



TO RUN THE UTILITY: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to "virtually" press buttons and throw switches on our lab Zybo boards,
please do the following:


1. Navigate to the python/ directory in this project folder
2. Open a terminal, and type:
	
	sh virtual_buttons_and_switches_python3.sh
   
   At the time of writing, it is known that ece40 does not have python installed correctly.

3. Pressing keys 1 through 4 will drive some of the Zybo board pins active high for
   100 milliseconds. Pressing keys 5 through 8 will toggle some other pins active high or
   low.

The "Buttons" are connected to the top row of the JA Header on the Zybo board.
The "Switches" are connected to the bottom row of the JA Header on the Zybo board.
